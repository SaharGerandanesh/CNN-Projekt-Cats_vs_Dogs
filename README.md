# CNN-Projekt-Cats_vs_Dogs
Description of the Dataset
Content: The dataset consists of 25,000 images of cats and dogs, with an even distribution between the two classes.
Format: The images are in JPEG format and vary in size (typically 256x256 pixels).
Usage: The dataset is intended for training machine learning models to classify images of cats and dogs.

Data Handling
"We started by splitting the dataset into three parts: training, validation, and test sets. To improve the model's accuracy, we also employed data augmentation."

Model Development
"Our model consisted of three convolutional layers followed by a fully connected layer and a dropout layer to prevent overfitting. We used a batch size of 32 and trained the model for 20 epochs."

Results
"The results were promising! The training accuracy increased from 53.8% to 84.9%, and the validation accuracy increased from 63.6% to 87.1%. Both training and validation losses also decreased significantly."

Discussion
"Despite these positive results, there is room for improvement. We can adjust the hyperparameters and expand the data augmentation to further enhance the model's performance. This model can create value by automating animal recognition in shelters and improving image search algorithms for retail."
